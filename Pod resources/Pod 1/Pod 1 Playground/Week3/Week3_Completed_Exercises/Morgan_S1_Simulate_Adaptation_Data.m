function S1_Simulate_Adaptation_Data(N_Participants)

% Here, we will simulate data from a study of split-belt treadmill
% adaptation. Changes in performance during motor adaptation tasks are
% often modeled using a double-exponential function that can capture early,
% rapid changes in performance, as well as more gradual changes that impact
% performance during the latter portions of adaptation.
% 
% We will use this knowledge to generate artifial data from a
% double-exponential function that has the following form. 
%
% $$SLA = A_f*e^{-B_f*n} + B_f*e^{-B_s*n}$$
%
% To generate a realistic dataset, we simulate three sources of variability
% covered observed in this type of data. First, we simulate intersubject
% variability by randomly selecing coefficients (A_f and A_s) and rate
% terms (B_s and B_f) from normal distributions centered at values taken
% from the literature. Second, we simulate noisy measurements and
% stride-by-stride variability by adding noise to the simulated step length
% asymmetry values. Lastly, since typical adaptation studies use a fixed
% _duration_ of adaptation, each participant may take a different number of
% total strides (largely because of differences in leg length). We simulate
% this source of variability by having each participant take between 800
% and 1100 total strides.

% Set the random number generator to the default state so that the results
% are reproducible.
