# EasyDemoToWordDoc
This is a repository focused on using R to generate a clean and modifiable word doc from a .csv data file.

There are 3 files to try out this script as an exercise and example of reproducible science.

1. README healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.txt - A README file for the example dataset which provides context of what the data file is about and what variables are within.
2. healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv - The example data set for this exercise. The README healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.txt has all the information for what this dataset is composed of.
3. Easy Demographics to Word Doc.R - The script which will import and manipulate the dataset to then be saved as a separate, modifiable word doc.
