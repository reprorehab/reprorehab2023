#THIS CODE IS MEANT TO TAKE A DATASET AND CONVERT IT INTO A DEMOGRAPHICS TABLE
#WHICH CAN BE THEN CONVERTED INTO A WORD DOC TO BE THEN USED AS PART OF A MANUSCRIPT
#THIS IS A WORKING EXAMPLE WITH A DATASET TAKEN FROM KAGGLE

#link here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset/

#IT IS FREE TO DOWNLOAD THOSE DATA, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE ALSO POSTED IN THE REPROREHAB FOLDER
